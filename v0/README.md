# Testnet v0

**Release Date**: 2019-12-19

## How to run a node

### Requirements

- Host computer with Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
- `Ubuntu 16.04` or `Ubuntu 18.04` (though other Linux distros are probably supported, more info coming soon).
- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Yarn
- Node.js

### Setup

1. Install [linux-sgx-driver](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver). After a successful installation you should see `/dev/isgx` in your system.

2. Download the `docker-compose.yml` from this folder, and make sure a `config/.enigma` folder exists.

3. `docker-compose up`, which should display something like the following logs:

```

4. Open a different terminal, and launch the command-line interface (CLI) for your node:

    ```
    docker exec -it worker cli
    ```

5. Type `setup` and enter your `staking address` when prompted. Enter `ok`

6. The software will then generate an `operating address` for you, which will be displayed on the logs and on the CLI.

7. Transfer some Kovan ETH (1 KETH will be plenty) to your `operating address`

8. In the `CLI`, type `register` and look at the node status box. After a successful registration the status will change to `Registered`.
In addition, you can look at the logs from the first terminal. You should eventually see a line like this:

    ```
    worker    | 2019-12-19T13:30:41Z INFO [P2P-MainController] - [REGISTER] successful registration
    ```
9. Next you need to `setOperatingAddress()` and `deposit()` with your `staking Address`. We provide a bare-bones NodeJS script until nicer and more friedly user interfaces (UIs) are built. See the `client/` folder for instructions.

10. Finally, in the CLI, type `login` and wait for the node status box to change to `Running`. 
In addtion, you may look at the logs from the first terminal, You should eventually see a line like this:

    ```
    worker    | 2019-12-19T13:30:41Z INFO [P2P-MainController] - [LOGIN] successful login
    ```

ðŸ™Œ CONGRATULATIONS ðŸ™Œ your node has successfully joined the Enigma Discovery Testnet and will start being eligible to run computations in the network at the next epoch change.
